This Teensy synth started out as a clone or Otem's Nimbus synth but since has mutated into its own thing.

The concept is to have a good-sounding synth that does not rely on any specific hardware configuration.
Currently only a Teensy 3.x with a Teensy Audio Adapter is required.

You could run the synth headless without any physical controls, and program it solely via MIDI, or you could add pots, buttons, and an LCD for improved editing.
